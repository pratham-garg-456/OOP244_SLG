## Discussion :
### 1. Define and explain the concepts of deep copying and deep assignment in the context of classes with resources. Why is it crucial to implement these mechanisms when dealing with resources, and how do they differ from shallow copying and shallow assignment?

### 2. Describe the purpose and functionality of the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator in a class with dynamically allocated resources. How do these two special member functions ensure proper handling of resource data during object instantiation and assignment?
