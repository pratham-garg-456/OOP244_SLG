### Q1. Constructor Basics:
- Write a class named **`Car`** with data members **`make`**, **`model`**, and **`year`**. Create a default constructor that initializes these variables using **`this`** keyword to empty state. And a display function which displays its details using **`*this`** keyword and if the object is in safe empty state it displays “Empty Car”.
- Create an object of the Car class and display its details.

### Q2. Overloaded Constructors:
- Enhance the **`Car`** class by adding an overloaded constructor that takes **`make`** and **`model`** as parameters and sets the **`year`** to the current year.
- Create another object using this overloaded constructor and display its details.
