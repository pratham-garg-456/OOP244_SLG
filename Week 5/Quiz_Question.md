### Q1. What is the purpose of having overloaded constructors in a class?
1. To confuse the programmer
2. To increase the size of the class
3. To provide different ways of initializing objects
4. To decrease the efficiency of the program

### Q2. If a class declares a constructor with parameters but does not declare a no-argument default constructor, what happens if I try to create empty object?
1. The compiler inserts an empty-body, no-argument default constructor
2. The program does not compile
3. The class cannot be instantiated
4. The compiler generates a warning but allows instantiation

### Q3. If an array of objects goes out of scope, when is the destructor called for each object in the array?
1. Before any other code in the program
2. In random order
3. In the order of array elements' creation (from the first to the last)
4. In the reverse order of array elements' creation (last to first)

### Q4. Which parameter type is used to access client code information in a member function?
1. Explicit parameters
2. Implicit parameters
3. Default parameters
4. Constant parameters
